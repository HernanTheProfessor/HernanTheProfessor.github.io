In this repository, I will be adding projects where you can see my progress in Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Machine Learning.
Some notebooks are in English and otros notebooks se encuentran en Espa√±ol.
Among others:

We can see, for example, the project of a base EDA as an intro to lay the foundations for the initial treatment of a dataset about cars.

We can see the project WORLD OF POTATO CHIPS where after an EDA we give some advice to the potato chips category manager.

Also, the "Spaceship Titanic" project, which is a Kaggle competition where supervised classification models are applied to predict some results.
